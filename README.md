# aws-utils

Small set of utility scripts for things I sometimes find helpful.

Currently there is only:

- SQS migrator - simply copies messages from 1 SQS topic to another.  Can be helpful for republishing a subset of DLQ messages.


### Future Work:
If I end up doing anything else with this, I'll probably:
-  break things down into sub-commands to make it easier to build/use.
